# Custom-Router

The Custom-Router package is an enhanced version of the Angular Router. It provides additional features and methods to manage navigation history and handle routing in a more customized manner.

## Features
1. Navigation History: The router maintains a history of navigation events, including the state, title, URL, and scroll position of each navigation event. This allows for more granular control over the navigation experience.

2. Sequential Navigation: The router provides methods to navigate back and forth through the history, similar to the native browser navigation. This includes the back, forward, and go methods.

3. State Management: The pushState and replaceState methods allow for pushing new entries to the history or replacing the current entry, similar to the native history.pushState and history.replaceState methods.

4. URL Navigation: The router provides methods to navigate to a specific URL in the history, either by absolute index or relative to the current index.

This package is particularly useful in complex Angular applications where the default Angular Router does not provide enough control over the navigation experience. It allows for a more customized and controlled navigation experience, making it easier to manage complex navigation flows.
